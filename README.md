# SmartGlasses
2023 - Present

Like many people after watching Spiderman: Far from Home, I became obsessed about the idea of wearing AI enabled glasses that put the power of a smartphone directly on my face. When I started this project back in May of 2023, many companies like Meta, Even Realities, and Rokid were still in development of their smart glasses, and ones that were available were quite expensive. So I decided to tackle this incredibly difficult project myself, taking on challenges like optics, electrical component selection, and app development.
